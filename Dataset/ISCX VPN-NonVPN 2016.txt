# ISCX VPN-nonVPN Dataset (ISCXVPN2016)

This dataset is sourced from the [UNB Cybersecurity Research Group](https://www.unb.ca/cic/) and contains network traffic data for research purposes. The information below is based on the dataset's official website: [ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset](http://205.174.165.80/CICDataset/ISCX-VPN-NonVPN-2016/).

## Dataset Overview

The ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset was created to represent real-world network traffic diversity and quantity. The dataset includes accounts for users named Alice and Bob, allowing for the use of various services like Skype, Facebook, and more. It captures both regular and VPN sessions, resulting in a total of 14 traffic categories, including VOIP, P2P, and more.

## Traffic Types and Applications

Here is a list of different types of traffic and applications considered in the dataset:

1. **Browsing**: HTTPS traffic generated while users browse the web or perform tasks involving a browser.

2. **Email**: Traffic samples generated using a Thunderbird client, configured for mail delivery through SMTP/S and receipt through POP3/SSL or IMAP/SSL.

3. **Chat**: Instant messaging applications, including Facebook, Hangouts (via web browsers), Skype, IAM, and ICQ (using the Pidgin application).

4. **Streaming**: Multimedia applications requiring a continuous stream of data, including YouTube and Vimeo services using Chrome and Firefox.

5. **File Transfer**: Traffic applications designed for sending or receiving files and documents. This includes Skype file transfers, FTP over SSH (SFTP), and FTP over SSL (FTPS) traffic sessions.

6. **VoIP**: Voice over IP traffic, encompassing voice calls using Facebook, Hangouts, and Skype.

7. **TraP2P**: Identification of file-sharing protocols like BitTorrent, captured by downloading .torrent files from a public repository and using uTorrent and Transmission applications.

## Dataset Details

- **Data Size**: The dataset includes 28GB of captured traffic data.

- **VPN Usage**: An external VPN service provider was used for VPN sessions, connected via OpenVPN (UDP mode).

- **SFTP and FTPS**: For SFTP and FTPS traffic, external service providers and Filezilla as a client were used.

- **Filtering**: To simplify the labeling process, unnecessary services and applications were closed during traffic capture. Only the objective application (e.g., Skype voice call, SFTP file transfer) was active.

- **Filtering by IP**: A filter was applied to capture only packets with source or destination IP addresses matching the local client's address (Alice or Bob).

## Data Processing

The ISCXFlowMeter tool, written in Java, is used to read the pcap files and create CSV files based on selected features.

## Dataset Availability

The UNB ISCX Network Traffic (VPN-nonVPN) dataset is available for research purposes. It includes labeled network traffic, full packet data in pcap format, and CSV files (flows generated by ISCXFlowMeter). Researchers can access the dataset through the following link:
