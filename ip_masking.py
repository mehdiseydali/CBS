"""
The code you have provided is a function called ip_masking(). This function takes a packet as input and masks the source and destination IP addresses of the packet.

The function first gets the IP header of the packet. The IP header is a 20-byte header that contains information about the source and destination IP addresses of the packet, as well as other information.

The function then splits the source and destination IP addresses into their individual octets. An octet is a group of 8 bits, which is equivalent to one byte.

The function then randomly selects one of the octets from the source and destination IP addresses. It then sets the value of this octet to 0.

The function then updates the source and destination IP addresses of the packet with the masked octets.

Finally, the function returns the masked IP header of the packet.
