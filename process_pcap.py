"""
The code you have provided is a function called process_pcap(). 
This function reads a pcap file and prints some information about each packet in the file.

The function first opens the pcap file and gets the number of packets in the file. 
It then iterates over the packets and prints the following information for each packet:

The packet number
The source IP address
The destination IP address
The source TCP port
The destination TCP port
Finally, the function prints the total number of packets in the file.


The first line opens the pcap file and gets the number of packets in the file. 
The RawPcapReader() function takes the name of the pcap file as input and returns an iterator that yields tuples of (packet data, packet metadata). 
The count variable keeps track of the number of packets processed.

The next line starts an iteration over the packets in the file. For each packet, the function first creates an Ether object from the packet data. 
The Ether class in the packet library represents an Ethernet packet. The function then creates an IP object and a TCP object from the Ether object. 
The IP class represents an IP packet and the TCP class represents a TCP packet.

The function then prints the following information for the packet:

The packet number
The source IP address
The destination IP address
The source TCP port
The destination TCP port
Finally, the function prints the total number of packets in the file.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

"""
def process_pcap(file_name):
    print('Opening {}...'.format(file_name))
    count = 0
    for (pkt_data, pkt_metadata,) in RawPcapReader(file_name):
        count += 1
        ether_pkt = Ether(pkt_data)
        ip_pkt = ether_pkt[IP]
        tcp_pkt = ip_pkt[TCP]
        print('packet number is: {}'.format(count))
        print(' IP src is: {}'.format(ip_pkt.src))
        print(' IP dst is: {}'.format(str(ip_pkt.dst)))
        print(' TCP sport is: {}'.format(str(tcp_pkt.sport)))
        print(' TCP dport is: {}'.format(str(tcp_pkt.dport)))



    print('{} contains {} packets'.format(file_name, count))
