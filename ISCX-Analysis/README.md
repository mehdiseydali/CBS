# Network Traffic Session Features Extractor

The code provided in `session_features.py` extracts statistical features from network traffic sessions in PCAP files and saves them to a CSV file. These features provide valuable insights into network traffic characteristics. The extracted statistical features include:

- **Interarrival Times**: Minimum, maximum, median, and standard deviation of the time between packets in a session.
- **Packet Lengths**: Minimum, maximum, median, and standard deviation of the packet lengths in a session.
- **Payload Sizes**: Minimum, maximum, median, and standard deviation of the payload sizes in a session.
- **Session Duration**: Total time of the session.
- **Active Time**: Total time that packets were being sent or received in the session.
- **Idle Time**: Total time that there was no packet activity in the session.
- **Packet Truncation**: Number of packets that were truncated in the session.
- **Total Packets**: Total number of packets in the session.
- **Bytes per Second**: Average number of bytes transmitted per second in the session.
- **Packets per Second**: Average number of packets transmitted per second in the session.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**: The code begins by reading PCAP files and extracting individual packets.

2. **Session Identification**: It groups the packets into sessions based on specific session attributes such as source IP address, destination IP address, source port, and destination port. Each session represents a distinct flow of network traffic.

3. **Feature Extraction**: For each session, the code calculates the statistical features listed above.

4. **CSV File Output**: The extracted statistical features are saved to a CSV file for further analysis and utilization.

## Use Cases

This code can be used for various network-related purposes, including:

- **Network Traffic Analysis**: The statistical features enable the identification of patterns and trends in network traffic. This information can be used to improve network performance and security.

- **Network Intrusion Detection**: The extracted features can serve as inputs to machine learning models for detecting malicious network traffic or anomalies.

- **Network Performance Monitoring**: By analyzing the statistics, you can monitor the performance of network applications and services, helping with troubleshooting and optimization.

## Conclusion

The `session_features.py` code provides a valuable tool for extracting statistical features from network traffic sessions. These features can be utilized for a wide range of network analysis and monitoring tasks, ultimately contributing to better network performance and security.
